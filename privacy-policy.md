# Privacy Policy

This policy explains how information is collected and used when you use the **TV Shows** application ("the App"). The App is a personal project created by [Joe Bailey](https://joebailey.xyz) that lets you track television shows and optionally sync upcoming episodes to a calendar.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information
- When you sign in with Google or GitHub, we store your name, email address and profile image.
- We create an internal user identifier to link your account data.

### TV Show Data
- When you add a show, episode information is fetched from Episodate and stored in our database so it can be displayed quickly.
- We record which episodes you mark as watched.

### Calendar Data
- If you connect a Google Calendar we store your calendar ID, access token and refresh token so we can add or remove events on your behalf.
- We can also generate an ICS feed for your shows. Anyone with the link (which contains your email address) can access your feed.

### Logs and Analytics
- Basic logs about requests are kept for troubleshooting. No analytics or advertising trackers are used.

## How We Use the Information
- To authenticate you and allow you to log in.
- To keep track of the shows you follow and the episodes you have watched.
- To sync episode dates to your Google Calendar or to generate an ICS file.
- To send verification emails when you sign in.

## Sharing of Information
- We use third‑party services to operate the App:
  - **Episodate** – to retrieve show and episode details.
  - **Google** and **GitHub** – for optional sign‑in.
  - **Mailgun** – to send authentication emails.
  - **Cloudflare D1** – to store the App's data.
- These providers only receive the information necessary to perform their functions.
- We do not sell or share your information with advertisers.

## Data Retention
- Your data is kept while your account remains active or as needed to provide the service.
- You may request deletion of your account and related data at any time.

## Your Rights
- You can request a copy of your data or ask us to delete it by contacting us.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy or about your personal data, please email **privacy@joebailey.xyz**.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the project repository.
